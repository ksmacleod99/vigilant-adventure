# Daily Shakespearean Insults
A vanilla JS portfolio project. Real simple, really just a project to help ease me back into coding. [View it live](https://main--vigilant-adventure-1d5f97.netlify.app/daily-insult/).

## Most important note: 
I couldn't find a free API for this project. I lifted these quotes from https://nosweatshakespeare.com/resources/shakespeare-insults/ and made my own JSON to fetch from.
