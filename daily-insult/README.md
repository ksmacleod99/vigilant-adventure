# Daily Shakespearean Insults
A vanilla JS portfolio project. Real simple, really just a project to help ease me back into coding. 

It is functionally complete. There are still some style updates I would like to make, and I need to add more quotes. I have a div commented out that is supposed to have "about" information in it. I haven't decided yet if I will use that or not.

## Most important note: 
I couldn't find a free API for this project. I lifted these quotes from https://nosweatshakespeare.com/resources/shakespeare-insults/ and made my own JSON to fetch from.
