## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Just practice. 
Though adding an image overlay on hover is a new one for me. 

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools - How To Create Image Hover Overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - good enough resource to figure out how to best make the image overlay on hover happen.
