## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow, with an eye to responsiveness
- [This](https://codepen.io/konradwax/pen/woPNqJ) sweet little button hover effect

### What I learned

This was a refresher/warm up for me. I've been head-down project managing software and I miss building it (not that I was ever great). I used HTML and CSS. I had to do a little bit of Googling to recall some things like how to do a drop-shadow, flexbox properties, and how to center a div on the viewport. 

I learned that there is a [@font-face](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) at-rule (I didn't use it).

I struggled with the corner bevels in CSS. I think my approach is pretty hacky.


### Continued development

Fix the footer -- it's a sticky footer but I just want it at the bottom. Didn't spend a lot of time on it because that's not the point of this challenge.

This design is simple enough, but complex enough, that I might attempt to re-create it in some Javascript framewok for practice.

### Useful resources

- [UICookies - 30+ CSS Button Hover & Click Examples](https://uicookies.com/css-button-hover/) - I needed some inspireation for the button hover state.
- [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) - contrast checker for accessability. The colors in this challenge fail to meet all WCAG guidelines (though they are pretty).
